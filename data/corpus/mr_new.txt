the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility . 
perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . " 
the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
 . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried . 
louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
[it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view . 
horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists . 
whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse . 
takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
 . . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish . 
green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . 
sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its �lan , humor , bile , and irony . 
has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
not a stereotype is omitted nor a clich� left unsaid . 
bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 
everybody loves a david and goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from david's point of view . 
the movie bounces all over the map . 
hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation . 
there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . 
an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
[davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it . 
a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
some episodes work , some don't . 
it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
 . . . tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry . 
the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it . 
theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . 
a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content . 
a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout . 
walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 
[sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions . 
i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
parents beware ; this is downright movie penance . 
to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
if only it were , well , funnier . 
helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . 
the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . 
the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
as saccharine as it is disposable . 
an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . 
potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention . 
these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
a few hours after you've seen it , you forget you've been to the movies . 
weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes . 
this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control . 
contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 
i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
best described as i know what you did last winter . 
pompous and garbled . 
the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook . 
labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich� . 
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were � i doubt it would be all that interesting . 
so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
a bad movie that happened to good actors . 
the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . 
flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up . 
about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos . 
more precious than perspicacious
the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . 
director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . 
most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door . 
it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
 . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel . 
predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance . 
though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . 
there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
 . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
 . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot . 
not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
just a kiss is a just a waste . 
die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest . 
shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
 . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
when the fire burns out , we've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails . 
i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . " 
despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j . k . rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore . 
you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there . 
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets . 
sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past , and it doesn't want to . 
kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
calculated swill . 
i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
not so much farcical as sour . 
[sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . 
a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
[a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . 
the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 
two-bit potboiler . 
the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 
those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . 
a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
 . . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 
 " freaky friday , " it's not . 
to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset . 
one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . 
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
[allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . 
a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie�if only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . 
with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
my own minority report is that it stinks . 
it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . 
some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . 
it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . 
it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else . 
for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
 . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 
where the film falters is in its tone . 
a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with . 
troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 
the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
 . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
little more than a well-mounted history lesson .

it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .

despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie
journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you .

a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit . 
the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .

 . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings .

at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
show me the mugging . 
madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time . 
lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . 
ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clich� of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .

more of a career curio than a major work . 
oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
 . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
 " my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! " yes , you are , ben kingsley . 
denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
[hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and clich� . 
seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 
[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago . 
stale , futile scenario . 
none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too . 
the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists . 
staggeringly dreadful romance . 
a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard .

suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal . 
the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 
it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there . 
just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 
at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap .

what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
aan opportunity wasted .

wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition � wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text � when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly . 
my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . . 
delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas . 
flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space . 
a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man . 
largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . 
mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
 . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions . 
it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb . 
the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys . 
like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom .

deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned . 
behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 
the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 
sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
what an embarrassment . 
it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
bottom-rung new jack city wannabe . 
barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .

director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 
at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
a cockeyed shot all the way . 
the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set . 
this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
 . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
the drama discloses almost nothing . 
fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . 
a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
this time kaufman's imagination has failed him . 
unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .

writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
� is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful . 
it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .

as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen .

when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .

harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
[t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
 . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . 
a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
holden caulfield did it better . 
there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .

the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
comedy troupe broken lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot . 
sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 
one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever .

 . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
degenerates into hogwash . 
this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless . 
with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .

though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .

you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book . 
no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story . 
its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
an encouraging effort from mccrudden
the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors . 
a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors . 
i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .

a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
fairly run-of-the-mill . 
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
black-and-white and unrealistic . 
frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .

it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
a porn film without the sex scenes . 
this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
i'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : this erotic cannibal movie is boring . 
about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 
the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes . 
 . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 
the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
bad and baffling from the get-go . 
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
extremely bad . 
this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clich�s . 
you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
[creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 
they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan . 
sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
yes , i suppose it's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i didn't . 
outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
madonna still can't act a lick . 
so clich�d that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
 . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
it's not original enough . 
this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation . 
we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 
haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -� audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song . 
welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
 . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension . 
drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 
kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both . 
abysmally pathetic
it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about . 
not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '
that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies . 
the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na�vet� and arbitrary flashbacks . 
interesting , but not compelling . 
no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 
whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . 
a processed comedy chop suey . 
thin period piece . 
the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
a ragbag of cliches . 
plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 
this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times . 
nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release . 
its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here . 
eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . 
a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh . 
rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the na�f's encounter with the world . 
the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . 
animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 
velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . 
'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source . 
director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . 
this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 
 . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book . 
well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
all the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling .
